getent passwd {1000..60000}
# Each user has a numeric user ID called UID
# If not specified when creating a new user with the useradd command, 
# the UID will be automatically selected from the /etc/login.defs file 
# depending on the UID_MIN and UID_MIN values.
# To check the UID_MIN and UID_MIN values on your system you can use the following command:
# grep -E '^UID_MIN|^UID_MAX' /etc/login.defs
# Knowing the minimal and maximal value allow us to query a list of all normal users in our system.
